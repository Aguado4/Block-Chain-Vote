# Blockchain Voting Application

This repository contains a blockchain-based voting application that leverages smart contracts to facilitate transparent and secure voting processes. The application is built using React for the frontend, providing an intuitive user interface for voters to cast their votes. 

### Key Features:

- **Frontend**: The user interface is developed with React, featuring dynamic components for voting, real-time vote counts, and visual feedback on user interactions.
- **Smart Contract**: The Solidity file (`vote.sol`) implements the core voting logic, allowing users to vote "Yes" or "No" while ensuring that each vote is recorded immutably on the blockchain.

### Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies for the frontend.
2. Deploy the smart contract on a blockchain network.
3. Connect the frontend to the deployed contract using the appropriate contract address and ABI.

### Contributing:

Contributions to enhance the application are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests for new features or bug fixes.
